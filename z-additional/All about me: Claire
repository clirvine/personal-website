All about me: Claire
I am an Australian born, Dutch girl (with Zimbabwean parents) living in Amsterdam with my Brazilian boyfriend and have a serious case of wonderlust that never seems to be satiated.
I grew up in a small(ish) town in Australia called Toowoomba (go on, laugh, I knkow you want to!) and moved to Brisbane when I was 19 to become a functioning member of society.
Mostly, this worked, I met some amazing friends and tried out some interesting roles that later helped me to get my first job in Amsterdam.
I have worked in administration all my life and am now very excited about starting my new Web Development course at New York Code and Design Academy. This will hopefully lead to some new and exciting opportuities for me in Amsterdam.
An interesting byproduct of this will be the inclusion into the tech industry which is obviously in full throws at the moment and there a myriad of stimiulating ideas being thrown around and it would be a fantastic opportunity to be able to get involved in the epicentre.
